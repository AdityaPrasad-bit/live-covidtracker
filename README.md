# live-covidtracker
This project is basically based on the live covid tracker. This project is based on the react. In this project it is showing how many cases are there in India, how many deaths have happend, how many cases are recovered, how many cases are confirmed and active. It is updated regularly. Here I used the api and with the help of axios.get I am getting the data regularly whicb is used for api call.
